                <div class="accent-line"></div>
                <div class="our-story-bio">
                    <p>Peter Reid, a native Haligonian, discovered a passion for the landscape profession through his high school summer employment.  He worked both as a construction laborer and as a grounds keeper at the Atlantic School of Theology.  In 1984, Peter established the Ottawa based company MacKinnon Reid & Associates in partnership with a long time family friend.  The company's original focus was the construction of interlocking paver patios, walks and driveways, however as customer requests for more sophisticated designs increased, Peter attained his Nova Scotia Agricultural College diploma in Landscape Horticulture and Design, graduating with honors.</p>
                    <p>MacKinnon Reid & Associates quickly established a benchmark for excellence in residential design/build, designing and implementing over 1000 creative projects.  As President and General Manager of this successfully growing business, Peter developed an effective organizational structure, implementing systems and processes which enabled him to sell the company in 2011.</p>
                    <p>Peter has now returned to Halifax, N.S. where he is raising his young family surrounded by family in a wonderful community complete with awesome scenery.  This return to his roots has also renewed his passion for landscape design.  Peter has recognized the Maritimes' need for a professional landscape design company with an interactive designing approach.  This need has led him to found Peter Reid Consulting, a company with over 40 years of experience to "draw" from.</p>
                    <p>Since returning, Peter has been working with many local landscape companies, designing and overseeing projects that range from simple designs in small spaces to some of the most complex and vast of his career.</p>
                    <p>As a testament to his commitment to professional excellence, Peter maintains active memberships with the Atlantic Association of Landscape Designers (AALD), Landscape Nova Scotia, and the Canadian Nursery Landscape Association (CNLA). These affiliations keep him connected to industry best practices and ensure he stays at the forefront of landscape design innovation.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, reflection on past projects has given clarity to the end goal which Peter believes is to transform outdoor space, making it more beautiful, more functional and more valuable.  This is what he aims to give his clients in every design he produces.</p>
